# DAY 3

## Question-1
- You are given a two lists  and . Your task is to compute their cartesian product X.
- Example 
```
A = [1, 2]
B = [3, 4]

AxB = [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]
```
## Solution
- Using the itertools product function we find the cartesian products of the two entered lists


## Question-2
- You are given a string S
- Your task is to print all possible permutations of size  of the string in lexicographic sorted order

## Solution
- Using the itertools permutations function we find the required permutations of the specified size
```
permutations('string', size)
```
