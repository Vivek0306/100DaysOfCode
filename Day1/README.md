###DAY 1

## Question-1
- Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
- You can return the answer in any order.

## Soution: 
- Initialize two loops, one starting from the first index and the second one starting from the index that is just once ahead.
- If the sum of the two indices is equal to the target return the indices.
